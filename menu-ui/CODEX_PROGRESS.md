CURRENT TASK: Complete public main media from committed assets.
STARTING MAIN: 1202b838acbbf71f586f69cb33c0a058c09f1d8d.

COMPLETED:
- Owner explicitly confirmed ownership/public redistribution for all supplied assets.
- Exact 16 reference payloads copied to assets/; 13,879,633 bytes, all SHA-256 match.
- Default Android.mk generates from checked-out assets; no mandatory private paths.
- Relocated generator/idempotence/missing/corrupt/symlink/path tests PASS.
- CI updated to run complete-media tests and verify actual linked ELF resources.
- Existing UI and both owner native files unchanged.

VERIFICATION COMPLETE:

MAIN PUBLICATION:
Source integration and build report pushed normally; remote main verified at
6830644073dc6d0d66c3abb19a5e115cc015d056. Owner file hashes and full tree match.
Initial Actions regression run used a shallow checkout; historical fixture
references were unavailable. CI checkout now fetches preserved history.

PUBLIC CI: SUCCESS, run 38583806540, source 4959326190a270d9b75f6968abfacd31a3a0f9e5.
12 public-source ASan/UBSan suites PASS and NDK ARM64 build PASS. Artifact ZIP
SHA-256/digest/CRC, actual ELF/source ID and absence of private media verified.
Remote rollback tag backup/embedded-working-49e56a7 added for tested source.

CURRENT TASK: Replace the remaining menu-header K with supplied circular photo.
BASE: d37eb87 (compiled source 49e56a7); owner reports UI/audio working.
BRANCH: release/embedded-media-integration

COMPLETED:
- Header and launcher share the same cached circular photo renderer/texture.
- No added asset loads, uploads, startup, audio, theme, feature or input changes.
- Header reference reset through existing texture/context lifetime handling.
- All 16 ASan/UBSan suites, original 37 bindings/ranges/callbacks and startup
  source audit PASS. Actual embedded photo command/fallback and UI capture PASS.

All 16 assets exact; private root loader ZIP CRC/hash PASS. Header image inspected.
Current published media.zip / version 0.8 matches previous 49e56a7 build.
See HEADER_LOGO_BUILD_REPORT.md / HEADER_LOGO_BUILD_VERIFICATION.json.
Main restoration choice pending; no production changes in this task.
Main contains owner native revisions absent from tested source; earlier explicit
instruction prohibits overwriting them. Public-media rights/comparator/secret
release gates remain unverified. No main/Anilxkenny promotion until resolved.

PROJECT: KennyPvtHax
CURRENT TASK: Private embedded-media presentation integration.
BRANCH: release/embedded-media-integration
BASE: 739a2de (runtime 1a944d4); owner-confirmed full UI 2a54a41.

COMPLETED:
- Prepared 16 validated read-only binary resources from the genuine private pack.
- Memory PNG/WAV registry loading; automatic bounded hash-checked private movie
  cache, existing decoder/mixer/input infrastructure retained.
- Supplied circular JPEG cropped/masked without changing artwork RGB pixels;
  full-circle launcher presentation, no inset square, unchanged hitbox.
- Removed default foreground Rias overlay; video OFF retains static fallback.
- Existing 15 sanitizer suites and focused actual embedded-media checks PASS.
  Actual private ImGui captures generated and inspected.

EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS / RELEASE GATES:
- Requested owner bypass/Lua revisions inspected, not integrated: new constructor,
  native patches and anti-cheat/crash-report suppression. Existing blank bypass
  and retained Lua source remain exact. No owner files overwritten on main.
- Public distribution rights, loader comparison, publishing secret/device gates
  not established; NOT PUBLISHED. No live kenny.json changes.

PROJECT: KennyPvtHax

CURRENT TASK: Supplied Anime video and photo launcher on ui/anime-video-logo.
BASELINE: 1438e94, preserving full UI/audio recovery/electric Classic and the
owner-working startup correction; blank Helper/bypass.h remains byte-identical.

COMPLETED:
- Validated actual 1024x576/30fps/40.634830s AVC movie (original bytes unchanged,
  runtime audio ignored) and 1280x1280 opaque JPEG photo. Lossless decoded-RGB
  RGBA PNG for existing logo texture interface; no invented alpha or artwork.
- Native MediaCodec/SurfaceTexture -> cached 2D GPU texture on existing GL owner,
  one paced worker/one pending frame, mute/loop/pause/Reduced/context cleanup and
  real still fallback. Existing Anime composition overlays Rias and controls.
- Photo replaces default floating K via existing launcher, fit/rounded rendering
  and cached minification, with safe K/selected character override fallbacks.
- Existing Settings video toggle/status, safe schema 6 extension, app-private
  fixed-path asset loader and optional owning-APK staging. No runtime download.
- Private combined package preserves earlier original/derived voices/artwork and
  all new media. Accurate installation contract: .so alone cannot install media.

VERIFICATION:
14 existing ASan/UBSan suites PASS plus real-media loader/persistence/pacing checks
and genuine ImGui media/launcher/toggle/input captures. Native movie preview
uses actual supplied frames decoded offline via FFmpeg, not Android MediaCodec.
37 binding/range/callback fixture and startup source audit PASS. Full ARM64
Actions 38555323354 SUCCESS, source 1a944d4; artifact 11888797483 digest/ELF/
source/NDK/dependencies verified. Library SHA-256:
42c556cafbfc067bf8e847d5159674c35cfd48ce7968cf643697c3431f257852.
Final focused menu/launcher/presentation sanitizer tests PASS after polish.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
No device decoder/GPU/audio/loop/FPS claim; physical device testing and approved
host private-pack installation remain necessary. Runtime movie is 30fps; host
review is 12fps offline. Photo was JPEG, not a transparent PNG. No live publication.

NEXT:
Owner installs verified matching 1a944d4 artifact and private media pack through
the actual owning host, then tests video, launcher, pause/resume/loop/Reduced
and unchanged feature/audio controls. No further development or publication.
Do not alter live Anilxkenny/kenny.json or redesign internal panels.

CURRENT TASK: Classic / Crimson Eclipse — Electric Starfield experiment.
BRANCH: ui/classic-electric-starfield.
OWNER-WORKING BASELINE: 2a54a41 full UI; development parent a374ad0, runtime
9a3de44 audio recovery. Previous ARM64 binary preserved unchanged. Startup fix
and blank Helper/bypass.h remain exact. No production loader publication.

COMPLETED:
- Actual attached 14.387-second H.264 reference inspected at four representative
  times; electrical/star language adapted procedurally, no embedded reference.
- Classic-only 17 fixed coherent filaments, braided companions, attached branches,
  three depth layers, seeded 32/64/96 stars and at most two traveling pulses.
- Existing Settings adds functional density/intensity/speed/pulse/local-Reduced
  preferences, below original audio controls. Default values match the task.
- Safe schema 5 extension reads versions 1–4; no feature/preferences reset.
- Hidden/inactive clock pause, stable resume, Reduced freeze, rounded geometry

VERIFICATION:
14 ASan/UBSan host suites pass; real original 37 bindings/ranges/callback fixture
passes. Focused final effect/capture/input checks and optimized measurements are
recorded with the build metadata. Actual original-versus-new renderer captures;
matched Aurora/Anime pixels unchanged. New previews inspected for clipping,
contrast and selector layout. No SDK/native/startup/audio/launcher modifications.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
No Android GPU/FPS/power/input/speaker claim; previous private media requirement
unchanged. ARM64 Actions 38547335985 SUCCESS for source 571d509, NDK 25.2.9519653.

CURRENT CHECKPOINT: A — Audio recovery, diagnostic/audio-recovery-a.
BASELINE: User-working compiled 2a54a41, source parent 5261a1e runtime-identical.
Downloaded reference SHA e2fc6995a2741cd51f385c5b54a420eb168c0b6c51ffa1c0bbb9ab6787ca2b3f.
Original main/startup/input/EGL/SDK/blank Helper/bypass.h unchanged.

CONFIRMED CAUSE: Owner installed only the .so; supplied recordings/private manifest
were not installed. Android speaker/OpenSL execution is not independently tested.
Actual Android host/installer source is absent; ImGui examples are not that host.

COMPLETED: Bounded load/voice/OpenSL transport diagnostics; callback-safe atomic
mailbox (no callback I/O). Existing Anime Settings Test Voice with distinct failure,
cooldown and queued results, selected configured event, no feature edits or masking
button tone. Indexed, checksum-validated private installation payload reuses existing
converted WAVs/cutout/originals, with explicit authorized host import/restart contract.
New attachments inspected: logo and Rias are JPEG, no alpha; Rias bytes match prior
source; video ZIP invalid (entry declares ~21MiB in 1.2MiB archive). B/C deferred.

VERIFICATION: All 13 ASan/UBSan suites PASS; focused post-fix test PASS; full
ARM64 build SUCCESS. Verified root loader ZIP, native ELF/hash, private payload
and corruption/path rejection checks. See AUDIO_RECOVERY_BUILD_VERIFICATION.json.
NEXT: Owner installs approved private pack through actual owning host, tests voice
and shares diagnostics. Do not claim audible Android output before device evidence.
No video/logo implementation, internal panel redesign or production publication.

CURRENT TASK: Supplied artwork/event voices on ui/supplied-rias-media.
BASELINE: Owner-confirmed full build 7934582; continuation parent c0dec26.
Removed Helper/bypass.h contents remain removed. Recovery branch unused.

COMPLETED: Five supplied attachments inspected/inventoried; four OGG originals
preserved, converted to existing mono 48kHz PCM16 WAV with measured attenuation.
User confirmed Extra navigation and pixel-preserving Python white-background mask.
Actual alpha cutout installed in private test/runtime bundle. Separate logo and
Bullet OFF clip absent; K/no-dialogue fallbacks retained. Central selected-character
routing, genuine widget edit guard and bounded per-event cooldown added. Existing
startup/input/EGL/SDK/Aurora/audio/launcher engines and 37 bindings unchanged.

VERIFICATION: All 12 ASan/UBSan host suites PASS; full ARM64 build SUCCESS.
Actual artifact/archive/ELF/hash validation PASS; see SUPPLIED_MEDIA_BUILD_VERIFICATION.json.
PRIVATE MEDIA: .verification/user-media/; never stage original/derived media in Git.
KNOWN LIMITATIONS: Android GPU/OpenSL playback/host asset installation require
owner device test. Native .so alone does not package APK media. No supplied logo.
NEXT ACTION: Owner installs matching 2a54a41 library plus private runtime pack,
selects supplied voice pack, and tests on Android before promotion.
No production loader publication.

CURRENT TASK: Full UI continuation on ui/full-theme-continuation.
WORKING BASELINE: 793458200ab8906179af0c63d0b0cb1648b7dafa; owner confirms
full Android build works; Actions 38407512326 succeeded. Removed component:
jni/Helper/bypass.h contents. Empty header preserved; recovery branch unused.

COMPLETED:
Existing full feature inventory recorded in FULL_UI_CONTINUATION.md.
Anime artwork visibility/control voice preferences, optional theme/Settings voice
mappings, schema-4 migration. Existing licensed media and 37 bindings preserved.

VERIFICATION: All 10 existing ASan/UBSan host suites + new continuation/capture
checks PASS. Full ARM64 Actions build SUCCESS; details in FULL_UI_BUILD_VERIFICATION.json.
KNOWN LIMITATIONS: Rias artwork/launcher/original voice missing. Installed clips
are the CC0 Cici Fyre alternative. Android GPU/audio/new runtime needs device test.
NEXT ACTION: Owner device-test the db93cc8 artifact before any promotion.
Never update production loader before that test.

FINAL DIAGNOSTIC BUILD VERIFICATION:
Code commit c975a6d; Actions run 38117222977 SUCCESS using unchanged NDK
25.2.9519653, arm64-v8a and full presentation. Runtime artifact 11694306093.
Actual ZIP CRC/digest, two-file contents, ARM64 ELF and exported host interfaces
verified. Runtime SHA256 9824c2841aabb36176d837d061d8cb0e1cf45ca48d271cc0640014553958ad14.
BuildID 42cdd97dec39e9eeceeaedf5c2e75fd36b46ba27. Report metadata in
DIAGNOSTIC_BUILD_VERIFICATION.json and KENNY_ANDROID_CRASH_DIAGNOSTICS.md.
Final sanitizer checks pass, including persistent append failures, report-cap
separation, and queued physical press-origin preservation. Secondary live EGL
contexts do not trigger repeated UI texture allocation; owner loss is diagnosed.
Initial native build passed compilation but the readelf/grep verification pipe
failed; corrected workflow reruns passed. No plaintext/private symbol archive
uploaded: age public-recipient secret missing. Source SDK/37 callbacks unchanged.
No Android runtime/actual Documents export/device crash root cause is claimed.
This final verification commit changes documentation only, not compiled code.


CURRENT TASK:
Emergency Android startup diagnostics and targeted lifecycle corrections.
Base: latest successful Actions source 7381b71 (NDK 25.2.9519653).

COMPLETED:
- Independent early logcat + bounded app-private checkpoint logger, durable
  rotation, failure handling and host-authorized FD export interface.
- Disabled destructive FixGameCrash deletion/report obstruction.
- Removed input-thread/pre-context ImGui access and invalid libinput thiz casts;
  bounded render-thread input handoff, global-init barrier and app publication.
- Checked window/EGL/dimensions/GLES3/backends; corrected embedded font ownership
  and context-loss GL-name lifecycle. Optional audio/asset failures are diagnosed.
- Preserved all 37 original full binding/range/callback statements and all offsets.
- Presentation-only isolation profiles; unchanged working NDK/module/ABI.
  Matching symbols retained locally and only uploaded encrypted if configured.

MODIFIED FILES:

tests/kenny_startup_audit.py; CODEX_PROGRESS.md; ANDROID_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md;
KENNY_ANDROID_CRASH_DIAGNOSTICS.md; DIAGNOSTIC_BUILD_VERIFICATION.json; README.md.

VERIFICATION:
Strict host logger/input checks pass, including actual SIGKILL persistence,
rotation/permissions/failure/concurrent writes/export. Actual embedded font atlas
build/clear/recreation passes ASan/UBSan. All 37 exact binding/range checks and
source startup gates pass. Rebuilt menu/C1/audio/theme/Aurora/effects/C2/C3 host
regressions pass. Diagnostic Actions result is recorded after dispatch below.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
Actual device root cause is not established. No Android runtime/GPU/audio or
Documents export has been tested here. The supplied project lacks the Java/Kotlin
host needed for authorized public export. Do not tap the retained manual Guest
Reset during diagnosis. Plain symbols are never uploaded to this public repo;
configure the age public-recipient secret for encrypted symbol retention.

NEXT ACTION:
Install the exact diagnostic ARM64 artifact through the original host pipeline,
record logcat before launch, retrieve private reports through authorized host/ADB,
and correlate the last successful checkpoint with a matching fatal backtrace.
No UI redesign or unrelated gameplay/SDK changes.

---

CURRENT TASK:
Owner-supplied original SDK restoration — completed locally for GitHub commit.

COMPLETED:
- Imported all 2,391 original SDK files unchanged to jni/SDK/ from SDK.zip.
- Removed the obsolete SDK ignore rule and updated current build documentation.
- Kept Android.mk, Application.mk, all application/UI code and existing media intact.

MODIFIED FILES:
jni/SDK/* (new), .gitignore, README.md, ANDROID_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md,
SDK_IMPORT_VALIDATION.json, CODEX_PROGRESS.md.

VERIFICATION:
Archive CRC and safe paths pass; all SDK files match original archive bytes.
All seven required SDK build/header inputs exist; all quoted SDK includes resolve.
Credential signature scan found no matches. Exact 37 binding/range checks pass.
Prior complete host regression results remain valid for unchanged application code.
Post-upload SDK file coverage/hashes are verified and reported separately.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
Android NDK unavailable; compatible release unknown. No native Android compilation,
linking, GPU/audio playback or device verification claimed. Prior export metadata
remains a historical record of the previously SDK-less ZIP.

NEXT ACTION:
Use a compatible genuine NDK to compile the existing native libAnoy.so project;
retain the original Android host/loader integration. No UI development started.

---

CURRENT TASK:
GitHub build backup — prepared for explicitly authorized PUBLIC publication.
Original application checkpoint: 3436f47; all 12 development commits preserved.
Destination: KennyPVTHax/KennyPvtHax-Backup, default branch main.

SCOPE:
Complete verified source export (991 paths), original untracked native/build
dependencies including all 40 supplied static libraries, existing build docs,
and five explicitly approved CC0 Cici Fyre runtime clips. Source/application
callbacks and 37 bindings/ranges unchanged. Public backup adds README, licensing
notes, machine-readable provenance and explicit .gitignore exceptions only.
The original Codex checkout and local private media remain untouched.

VERIFICATION / LIMITS:
Both export hashes verified; 12 historical commits/146 blobs and current source
scanned without high-confidence secrets or suspicious credential assignments.
Public pins/runtime token variables were reviewed, not mistaken for secrets.
Previous restored-export host checks pass. Final GitHub coverage and fresh-clone
host tests are reported after upload; no Android build or device claim.

EXCLUDED:
All six permission-unverified OGGs, duplicated 57 original recordings, private
media archive, previews/caches/test binaries and the genuine SDK. No release.

NEXT:
Clone the normal repository as KennyPvtHax; restore original jni/SDK/ locally
and use the original compatible NDK (exact version unknown). Build libAnoy.so
through the existing ndk-build/original host application workflow. No UI/Anime
acquisition/key-entry work starts as part of this publication.

---

CURRENT TASK:
Complete Android source export — verified, 11 October 2026 (Asia/Calcutta).
Application HEAD preserved at 3436f47. Further UI/asset/key development paused.

COMPLETED:
- Full source export includes actual current C++/UI/native code, all original
  untracked dependency sources/headers/fonts, required Login.h, all 40 original
  prebuilt libraries, build scripts and documentation. Git-only export avoided.
- Separate private media archive: five mapped CC0 runtime alternatives, 57
  unchanged licensed originals/creator readme, six unchanged unmapped uploaded
  OGGs. No character artwork/original Rias voice fabricated or newly acquired.
- No tracked application source or original build script changed; HEAD/history
  unchanged. Added ANDROID_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md and this progress entry only.
- Confirmed all tracked files exist, original include structure, no exportable
  symlinks, 20 referenced AArch64 libraries, archive CRC/entry/byte/hash equality
  and finite credential scan without high-confidence findings. Source/media
  inventories/checksums and local recovery helpers accompany the export.
- Reran 37 bindings/ranges/callback extraction, menu/C1/audio/theme/store/Aurora/
  effects/C2/C3 host tests and media validation. Fresh strict portable-header
  and C3 builds pass. Existing regression binaries reuse unchanged source.

DELIVERABLES:
/workspace/kenny-android-export/KennyPvtHax-Android-Build-Source.zip
/workspace/kenny-android-export/KennyPvtHax-Private-Media.zip
ANDROID_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md, EXPORT_MANIFEST.txt, SHA256SUMS.txt,
SOURCE_FILE_INVENTORY.json, PRIVATE_MEDIA_INVENTORY.json, VERIFY_EXPORT.py,
DOWNLOAD_HELP.md and smaller byte-exact download parts are in that export folder.
Archive hashes/file counts are recorded outside the source ZIP to avoid a
self-referential archive checksum. No Git/public/external upload performed.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS / NEXT ACTION:
- Restore genuine original SDK at jni/SDK/. NDK/version unavailable/unknown.
- This build produces arm64-v8a libAnoy.so, not an APK. Original app packaging/
  runtime integration must be supplied; no replacement APK system invented.
- Android compile/link/OpenSL/GLES/private staging/device performance remain
  unverified. Rias artwork/original voice permissions/content unresolved.
- Download copies/parts are prepared; actual Android browser retrieval cannot
  be verified from the tools. No generic artifact-upload API is exposed. If all
  links fail, use authenticated workspace retrieval or separately authorize a
  private source/media transfer destination; never the preview repository.
- STOP after export. Next separately authorized task: original SDK restoration
  and the first real Android build. No more UI/Anime/key-entry work now.

---

CURRENT STAGE:
Phase C3 — Asset Acquisition and Validation — completed feasible integration,
host-verified. Parent: 6f300ae. Rias rights/content/artwork unresolved; original
Rias media are NOT fully installed. Historical checkpoints below are preserved.

COMPLETED:
- Reviewed all three supplied artwork pages, Sounds Resource terms/help and Cici
  Fyre creator/license statements. Recorded exact URLs/credits/limits without
  treating mirror noncommercial labels as underlying authorization.
- Artwork/launcher acquisition deferred: permissions unresolved, no original PNG
  alpha/quality available. Advertised dimensions/aspect ratios recorded honestly.
- All six uploaded OGGs full-decode, with exact bytes/SHA-256 retained. No guessed
  transcripts/mappings, no conversion/shortening. 8.162948-second clip exceeds the
  existing four-second runtime limit; original recordings remain outside assets.
- Downloaded Cici Fyre's CC0 pack normally, checked ZIP CRC/safe extraction and
  fully decoded all 57 unchanged originals. No access-control/CAPTCHA bypass.
- Installed five full-length 48 kHz PCM16 mono derivatives as explicitly labeled
  Cici Fyre - English alternative, NOT authentic Rias/Yoko Hikasa. Seven existing
  event mappings; English labels corroborated with unconstrained recognition,
  conflicting results excluded. Original float32/stereo files retained privately.
- Existing C2 registry, Settings, C1 mixer and appearance store work unchanged.
  Original Rias manifest references/fallbacks remain. No source/GitHub publication.
- Generated and inspected nine actual C++/ImGui screenshots, contact sheet and
  C2 comparison, plus actual C1 mixer WAV, offline viewer and private ZIP.

  cici_okay_happy.wav, cici_okay_normal.wav, cici_no_problem.wav under the Rias pack.
  Media, archives, models and generated previews are NOT committed.

VERIFICATION:
- PASS all 24 tracked jni files byte-identical to 6f300ae; approved Aurora/Classic/
  C1/C2/SDK/gameplay untouched. Exact 37 bindings/ranges/formats and original
  callback extraction pass against 58cbf6c.
- PASS strict C3 C++17/-Wall/-Wextra/-Werror build: actual five clips/seven mappings,
  truthful partial pack, missing original/event, C1 PCM mix, cooldown/mute/volume,
  100 theme cancellations and fresh-store selected-pack/preferences round-trip.
- PASS six unchanged uploaded OGGs, 57 originals, five derivatives: full decodes,
  hashes/archive CRC, unchanged full frame counts; downmix error below two PCM16
  units. Permission review is manual, not inferred by automated integrity checks.
- PASS rebuilt strict C2 loader/registry/migration tests with isolated missing
  root: alpha/corruption/paths/audio/resource bounds, 500 switches and 10,000
  allocation-free cached dispatch/mix iterations.
- PASS existing menu, C1 launcher/audio, theme/store, Aurora and effects suites:
  controls/navigation/drag/close/reopen/scroll/viewport, real event dispatch,
  persistence, 1,000 warmed menu frames, 20,000 allocation-free audio iterations,
  50,000 concurrent queue submissions, unchanged Aurora physics/draw and clipping.
- PASS native C3 selector/voice enable/0–100 volume/global mute, 36-pixel small
  selector and unchanged original feature snapshots. Corrected test's outside
  right-edge click, without changing application slider code.
- PASS eleven PNG integrity/full decodes, source/output hashes, actual C1 ten-second
  mixer WAV, self-contained viewer and 15-entry ZIP. Both matched Aurora and
  Classic screenshots are pixel-identical to C2. Visuals inspected.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- Rias artwork, alpha/quality, transparent launcher, authentic recordings and
  uploaded spoken content/underlying permissions remain unverified. Candidate
  mirror/archive permissions are reported for user review; no response assumed.
- Runtime requires PCM16 WAV <=4 seconds; uploaded OGGs are unsupported, longest
  exceeds the duration cap. None is silently converted/truncated/embedded.
- Speech verification is machine recognition, not human audition. Cici Fyre is
  clearly an English alternative; character remains partially installed.
- Media are ignored/private: a Git checkout alone does not include recordings.
  Preserve this workspace voice directory for the original app's packaging.
- Intentionally omitted SDK, unavailable NDK/device: Android compile/link,
  OpenSL playback, GLES alpha/resource lifecycle, APK staging/private restart,
  touch/performance remain UNVERIFIED. Host screenshots/PCM are not device tests.

NEXT ACTION:
STOP after C3. Inspect previews/phase_c3/index.html and C3_ASSET_VALIDATION.md.
Obtain permitted original RGBA artwork/launcher files and rights-holder permission
plus verified transcripts for uploaded recordings before original Rias mapping.
Retain private installed alternative clips. Do not begin key-entry, Android
release or Stage 6 automatically. Get focused checkpoint with git log -1.

CURRENT STAGE:
Phase C2 — Anime Character Integration — COMPLETE infrastructure (host-verified).
Parent checkpoint: c5e9ef0. Actual Rias artwork/launcher/recordings remain missing.
All earlier implementation and Git history preserved. Historical checkpoints follow.

COMPLETED:
- Added the centralized Rias Gremory / High School DxD definition, ID highschool_dxd_rias, and extensible local character/voice-pack registry.
- Searched permitted artwork/recordings; no source established permission for the requested assets. Downloaded/integrated media: ZERO. No substitute artwork, cloned voice or diagnostic character media installed.
- Implemented bounded offline RGBA PNG and PCM16 WAV loading, actual alpha preservation, transparent aspect-fit character layer, cached GLES texture integration/context handling and optional APK-to-private staging.
- Integrated character-specific transparent launcher reference using the unchanged C1 drag/touch/transition engine, with K fallback outside Anime or when unavailable.
- Extended existing Anime Settings with selection/status, launcher preference, installed voice packs, voice enable/volume and explicit missing/backend feedback. Unavailable controls are disabled; selectors retain 36-pixel minimum height.
- Reused C1 OpenSL/player/dispatcher/four effect voices; added one exclusive recorded character channel, event mappings, bounded variations, cooldown, independent gain, global mute precedence and cancellation on theme/character/pack changes.
- Preserved all appearance/audio settings using schema 3 at the same private path, with schemas 1/2 compatibility and safe invalid/unknown character fallback.
- Generated/inspected actual C++/ImGui host output, baseline comparison, contact sheet, private offline viewer and ZIP. No source/media upload or publishing.

MODIFIED FILES:
- jni/KennyAssetIO.h (new): guarded local paths, bounded transparent RGBA PNG and PCM WAV decoders.
- jni/KennyCharacters.h (new): metadata/pack registry, cache, texture ownership, voice routing/variation and character composition.
- jni/KennyCharacterGL.h (new): Android GLES upload/delete and optional local APK staging.
- jni/KennyAudio.h: immutable recorded PCM, exclusive character channel, mute/cancellation/gain and event router, preserving original effect voices.
- jni/KennyAndroidAudio.h: existing callback activity also considers the character channel; no second backend.
- jni/KennyControls.h: existing successful checkbox event carries its label for semantic routing.
- jni/KennyThemePreferences.h: normalized character/pack/artwork/voice/launcher preferences.
- jni/KennyAppearanceStore.h: compatible schema 3 persistence.
- jni/KennyAppearance.h: existing Anime Settings and character-aware Style composition/status.
- jni/KennyMenu.h: registry state, scoped voice setup and Anime-only character layer.
- jni/main.cpp: UI-only staging/cache/texture/launcher integration; original callback/native/gameplay sections unchanged.
- assets/anime/index.json; assets/anime/highschool_dxd_rias/manifest.json; assets/anime/highschool_dxd_rias/ASSET_SOURCES.md (new): metadata only, no media.
- tests/kenny_c2_check.cpp; tests/kenny_c2_fixtures.py; tests/kenny_c2_capture.cpp; tests/kenny_c2_baseline.py; tests/kenny_c2_package.py (new): focused loaders/registry/voice/persistence checks and genuine host evidence.
- tests/kenny_theme_check.cpp: current-schema wording; tests/README.md: C2 reproduction/limits.
- .gitignore: private character media and generated C2 previews excluded.
- ANIME_CHARACTER_ASSETS.md (new), UI_DESIGN_NOTES.md and CODEX_PROGRESS.md: current architecture, asset sources/status, verification and resume instructions.

VERIFICATION:
- PASS strict portable production-header syntax and C2 builds with C++17/-Wall/-Wextra/-Werror. Initial allocation-counter instrumentation warning was corrected with non-inlined new/delete hooks; strict rebuilt test passes.
- PASS exact 37 original binding/range/format statements and entire original feature callback. Source before/after the UI block, approved Aurora/theme/effect headers and Android build files unchanged versus c5e9ef0.
- PASS existing native menu regressions: all controls/ranges/keyboard input, five categories/seven panels, tab memory, dragging, close/reopen, scrolling/viewport fit, balanced stacks, 90 theme switches and 1,000 warmed allocation frames.
- PASS existing C1 launcher/audio checks: bounded hitbox, drag/transition/input isolation, actual successful sound events, mute/volume, passive/slider silence and repeated cycles without growing allocations.
- PASS original PCM/mixer/queue/thread suite: distinct profiles, four effect voices, 31 queued commands, mute/volume/throttling, 20,000 allocation-free dispatch/render iterations and 50,000 concurrent SPSC submissions.
- PASS appearance/store tests: atomic 0600 saves, fresh-instance restart, schema 1/2 migration, malformed data/storage failures and no idle writes. C2 checks schema 3 round-trip and retention of valid old fields for invalid new references.
- PASS approved Aurora exact default physics for 1,800 steps/byte-identical draw geometry; 20,000 variable-dt particle steps, 600 clipped geometry samples and 1,000 warmed allocations. Existing effect geometry/math/allocation tests also pass.
- PASS C2: byte-exact 0/128/255 PNG alpha; corrupt/truncated/opaque rejection; traversal/absolute/symlink/FIFO rejection; bounded JSON and WAV validation/downmix/resample; registry extension/selection; cached texture callback lifecycle; actual C1 voice mix/routing/variation/cooldown/global mute/voice volume; missing-recording C1 fallback; 500 switches; 10,000 allocation-free cached dispatch/mix iterations; aspect-fit UV/bounds and safe reference normalization.
- PASS native Rias selection with missing assets and 36-pixel selector at 640×360. Original feature snapshots unchanged in all new captures.
- PASS 12 PNG integrity/full decodes, SHA-256 provenance, offline viewer and 15-entry ZIP. Actual C1 versus C2 Classic image is pixel-identical; Aurora differs by one channel level at one header pixel. Settings, small scrolling viewport, K fallback and comparison inspected.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- Rias artwork, transparent launcher and ALL eleven authorized voice recordings are still absent. Their actual character rendering/playback cannot be visually/audio verified until permitted files are supplied. No pack is presented as fully installed.
- Missing SDK was intentional; NDK/device unavailable. Android compile/link, optional APK staging, private activity storage/restart, GLES alpha/context/resource lifecycle, OpenSL voice playback, real touch and mobile performance remain UNVERIFIED.
- Host PNGs are actual production ImGui geometry CPU-rendered, not Android captures. Diagnostic test pixels/tone fixtures remain solely in ignored .verification and never serve as Rias previews/recordings.
- Supported media are noninterlaced 8-bit RGBA PNG and bounded PCM16 WAV only. WebP, palette/RGB PNG and compressed MP3/OGG/WAV require conversion; unsupported/corrupt assets fall back safely.
- Registry initializes once; replacing media requires restart. Caches are bounded to 32 MiB decoded data; voices must outlive the existing player. Original font macro warnings and destructive/platform callback verification limitations remain.

NEXT ACTION:
STOP after C2. Review previews/phase_c2/index.html and ANIME_CHARACTER_ASSETS.md. Obtain permitted character.png, launcher.png and optional mapped voice recordings, install using the documented private/APK layout, then verify on the real Android build/runtime when separately authorized. Do not begin key-entry or release/Stage 6 automatically. Get the focused C2 hash with git log -1.

REFERENCE NOTES:
- previews/phase_c2/: anime-style.png, anime-player.png, anime-settings.png, anime-voice.png, anime-launcher-fallback.png, anime-voice-640.png, aurora-player.png, classic-player.png, c1-aurora.png, c1-classic.png, contact-sheet.png, non-regression.png.
- Offline viewer index.html; bundle kennypvthax-c2-previews.zip; provenance verification.json. All private/local; no GitHub upload.
- ASSET_SOURCES.md records examined URLs/permission limitations. Rias manifest filenames are expected local assets, not supplied files or proof of licensing.

---

CURRENT STAGE:
Phase C — Checkpoint C1: Interactive K Launcher and UI Sound Events — COMPLETE (host-verified)
Parent application commit: 5fa7574. C2 and Stage 6 remain deferred.

COMPLETED:
- Retained the approved Aurora engine, three themes, layout and all original feature behavior.
- Replaced the old floating Menu/Close toggle with the existing K emblem launcher: bounded native tap, drag/reposition, viewport clamp, theme treatment, preserved section/window position and lightweight open/close fade. Reduced motion snaps immediately.
- Added a reusable transparent texture/logo rendering reference with aspect-fit, missing/invalid fallback and explicit external texture cleanup contract; no final logo invented.
- Added interaction-only theme-aware dispatcher, actual original synthesized Classic/Aurora PCM, bounded four-voice mixer and Android OpenSL ES adapter. No music, voices, per-tap loads or per-frame initialization.
- Added functional mute/volume/profile Settings controls, unavailable-backend feedback and private audio preference persistence. Existing schema 1 migrates without losing any appearance preferences; schema 2 retains the same file path.
- Added future key sound names/interfaces only; all remain unused. C2 voice packs, sound-file loading, key/authentication and Stage 6 are not implemented.
- Closed/fading controls cannot receive input; sliders, passive frames and star interaction remain silent. No original native input hook/gameplay/SDK change.
- Generated and inspected actual native host previews, genuine portable-mixer WAV demos, offline viewer, provenance and ZIP. Preserved earlier evidence.

MODIFIED FILES:
- jni/KennyAudio.h (new): event vocabulary, deterministic PCM bank, fixed mixer, scoped/throttled dispatcher.
- jni/KennyAndroidAudio.h (new): real OpenSL ES backend, bounded buffers, idle stop/wake, shutdown/failure handling; explicit unavailable host branch.
- jni/KennyLauncher.h (new): native K launcher, drag/tap state, transitions and external logo texture contract.
- jni/KennyIdentity.h: share the existing emblem without changing its header drawing.
- jni/KennyControls.h: successful checkbox/button/choice event hooks; original sliders untouched.
- jni/KennyAppearance.h: actual theme-change event and audio Settings controls/status/selector.
- jni/KennyThemePreferences.h: UI sounds, volume and profile preferences.
- jni/KennyAppearanceStore.h: schema 2 audio fields and compatible schema 1 reader.
- jni/KennyMenu.h: scoped audio, navigation events, transition alpha, explicit closing root/child input isolation, audio Settings status.
- jni/main.cpp: replace UI-only toggle integration with launcher/audio setup/pump; entire original callback and all code outside UI integration preserved.
- jni/Android.mk: link platform OpenSLES only.
- tests/kenny_audio_check.cpp (new): actual portable PCM/event/queue/thread/allocation tests and WAV output.
- tests/kenny_c1_check.cpp (new): real native launcher/menu/audio-control interactions and captures.
- tests/kenny_c1_package.py (new): native raster previews, original PCM demos, integrity/provenance/viewer/ZIP.
- tests/kenny_host_fixture.py: current callback extraction endpoint; all 37 statements/body still exact.
- tests/kenny_menu_host_check.cpp: record real popup item geometry for native selector testing.
- tests/kenny_theme_check.cpp: audio round-trip, legacy migration and malformed schema 2 checks.
- tests/README.md: C1 reproduction and verification boundaries.
- .gitignore: generated previews/phase_c1/ excluded.
- UI_DESIGN_NOTES.md and CODEX_PROGRESS.md: C1 architecture, evidence, limitations and resume checkpoint.

VERIFICATION:
- PASS exact 37 original bindings/ranges/formats and complete feature-panel/callback body; original input/gameplay/native sections unchanged versus 5fa7574.
- PASS strict C++17 portable production-header syntax and strict audio/theme/aurora/effects builds. Android-only OpenSL branch not compiled.
- PASS original native seven-panel regression: controls, float/int ranges, keyboard/numeric entry, five categories/subtab memory, header dragging, close/reopen, five viewports, scrolling, no horizontal clipping, balanced stacks, themes/appearance actions, 1,000 warmed route frames and 90 theme switches.
- PASS actual PCM recipes/mixer: bounded deterministic profiles, distinct toggles, four voices/31 commands, saturation, mute/volume/epoch behavior, scope/throttle/time checks, unavailable backend, 20,000 allocation-free iterations, 50,000 concurrent SPSC submissions.
- PASS actual native C1 interactions: bounded/outside launcher, drag without open, viewport fit, fades/Reduced targets, routing/window preservation, closing controls disabled, actual checkbox/button/nav/theme/selector events, mute/volume, passive/slider/background silence and balanced stacks. 120 repeated cycles; inactive ImGui buffers retire 105→98 allocations, then counts remain 98; no growth. Original feature snapshot unchanged after restoring deliberate test edits.
- PASS actual filesystem persistence: all audio fields, real schema 1 migration preserving ten existing fields, schema 2 fresh-instance restart, corrupt/nonfinite/trailing rejection, atomic 0600 writes, inactive/deferred behavior and safe storage failures.
- PASS exact approved default Aurora physics for 1,800 steps and byte-identical draw geometry; existing 20,000 physics-step/600 geometry/1,000 allocation aurora tests and 1,000 effect geometry/allocation tests pass.
- PASS 10 PNG full decodes, two 48kHz/16-bit mono WAV full FFmpeg decodes, source/hash provenance, self-contained viewer and 15-entry ZIP. Inspected actual launcher detail and full/small Settings previews.
- PASS focused diff and explicit source whitelist; no original untracked dependencies, secrets, binaries or generated assets committed.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- Missing SDK was intentional; NDK/device unavailable. Full Android compilation/link, real OpenSL sound playback/callback shutdown/latency, activity-private storage/restart, overlay/touch/GPU/texture lifetime and mobile performance remain unverified.
- The actual portable PCM tests/demos are host output, not mocked Android playback. Host UI correctly disables audio controls; separately labeled PCM-test Settings capture uses the real portable mixer. No device sound/FPS claim.
- Custom transparent logo upload/delete remains external-owner responsibility; no supplied final logo/decoder. Clear the reference before deleting texture/context.
- Anime voice recordings, pack loader, clip mappings/variation and format decoding await C2 approval/assets. Safe behavior now is optional UI tones with no voice controls or file loading.
- Original embedded-font macro warnings remain untouched. The destructive Guest Reset platform callback stays connected but is not invoked by host tests.

NEXT ACTION:
STOP after C1. Review previews/phase_c1/index.html, launcher-detail.png and the two PCM demos. Await explicit user approval before C2 — Anime voice-pack infrastructure. Do not begin C2 or Stage 6 automatically. Retrieve the focused checkpoint hash with git log -1.

REFERENCE NOTES:
- Actual C++/ImGui UI headers, extracted original controls and embedded fonts generate screenshots through the native draw-data CPU rasterizer; no separate mockup/AI screenshot.
- previews/phase_c1/: launcher-aurora.png, launcher-anime.png, launcher-classic.png, launcher-detail.png, opening.png, player.png, closing.png, settings.png, settings-640.png, audio-test-settings.png.
- aurora-sounds.wav and classic-sounds.wav each contain menu open/close, checkbox on/off, button, primary/secondary navigation, theme-change at 35% UI gain. Browser WAV playback does not verify Android.
- Offline viewer: index.html. Bundle: kennypvthax-c1-previews.zip. Hash/source evidence: verification.json. Previous preview directories/checkpoints retained.

PREVIOUS PHASE B CHECKPOINT — RETAINED HISTORY:
The following describes the preceding checkpoint and its original stop point.

PROJECT: KennyPvtHax

CURRENT STAGE:
Stage 5.6 — Phase B: Custom Theme System — COMPLETE (host-verified)

COMPLETED:
- Continued from approved 58cbf6c without restarting, reverting or changing SDK/gameplay integrations.
- Added immediate Aurora / Anime / Classic native Style cards; Aurora remains default and runs across all seven panels.
- Added functional Aurora intensity, star visibility, touch attraction and particle activity controls. Default physics/curtains remain approved and unchanged.
- Added asset-ready static texture/frame-provider architecture, rounded Cover/Contain image drawing, conditional real dimming/fit preferences and honest missing-artwork fallback. No substitute artwork or voices.
- Added Classic static materials with inactive Aurora/asset processing paused; retained branding, layout, navigation, controls, opacity, spacing, Reduced motion, dragging, scrolling and close/reopen.
- Added isolated, versioned app-private appearance persistence. Active sources have no feature config save/load; original feature configuration is untouched. Theme and every appearance preference restore from the UI-only file, with validation and visible failure fallback.
- Retained all 37 exact binding/range/format statements and the entire original feature-panel/callback body; no SDK replacement, new permissions/dependencies, sound/logo/key-entry features or Phase C work.
- Generated and inspected actual production C++/ImGui host previews of every Aurora panel and all three themes. Saved 15 valid PNGs, self-contained viewer, provenance and 18-entry ZIP under previews/phase_b/.

MODIFIED FILES:
- jni/KennyThemePreferences.h (new): UI-only theme/preferences model, defaults, normalization and comparisons.
- jni/KennyAppearanceStore.h (new): private bounded versioned load, atomic 0600 save, release/hide synchronization and error status.
- jni/KennyThemeBackground.h (new): Classic/fallback static surfaces; externally owned artwork texture/provider lifecycle and rounded image drawing.
- jni/KennyAppearance.h: native theme cards, functional theme-specific preferences, retained shared preferences and Reset.
- jni/KennyAurora.h: optional intensity/visibility/activity integration; separate particle clock with exact approved default behavior.
- jni/KennyMenu.h: all-panel theme routing, native touch ownership, inactive-effect pause, artwork state and store synchronization.
- jni/main.cpp: private appearance path/flush only, outside unchanged feature callback.
- tests/kenny_host_fixture.py: exact approved binding/panel-body comparison and read-only approved aurora snapshot.
- tests/kenny_menu_host_check.cpp: retained suite plus Phase B native switching/options/all-theme input/pause/allocation checks; new capture prefixes preserve Phase A evidence.
- tests/kenny_theme_check.cpp (new): filesystem restart/failure/schema tests, approved physics/draw equivalence and real asset geometry/provider tests.
- tests/kenny_phase_b_capture.cpp (new): actual seven-panel/three-theme/small-viewport captures, unchanged feature state.
- tests/kenny_phase_b_package.py (new): real draw-data rasterization, PNG integrity/provenance, contact sheets/viewer/ZIP.
- tests/README.md: Phase B reproduction and verification boundaries.
- .gitignore: ignores previews/phase_b/ generated output.
- UI_DESIGN_NOTES.md and CODEX_PROGRESS.md: architecture, controls, persistence, test evidence and resume checkpoint.
- Ignored output: generated approved/header fixture, executables, atlas/draw/state/RGBA files, preview PNG/HTML/JSON/ZIP. No binaries, credentials or unrelated original untracked files committed.

VERIFICATION:
- PASS source fixture: all 37 exact binding/range/format statements and complete original panel/callback body unchanged versus 58cbf6c.
- PASS strict C++17 production-header syntax (-Wall -Wextra -Werror); strict standalone theme/store/asset and aurora/effects builds.
- PASS full real native seven-panel suite: original checkboxes/sliders/ranges/keyboard/numeric entry, shared/conditional configuration, navigation, actions, drag/close/reopen, scrolling, five viewports and balanced stacks.
- PASS 90 native theme-card switches, same-frame routing, Aurora progression on all seven routes and no Aurora processing in Anime/Classic. Real controls drive intensity geometry, star/activity pause and touch permission.
- PASS every original checkbox site touched/restored under all three themes at 640×360; existing ranges and bindings unchanged. Feature snapshots remain identical after presentation actions.
- PASS store restart round-trip of every preference and theme, Reset, private 0600 writes, no idle rewrites, active-edit deferral, schema/corruption/nonfinite/trailing-data/bounds checks, missing path and write-failure fallback.
- PASS 1,800 approved/default physics steps with exact time/response/position/velocity equality; actual default vertices/UVs/colors/indices byte-identical to the approved 58cbf6c renderer.
- PASS static/provider invalid-frame handling, same-frame idempotence, inactive-gap pause, Reduced frame hold, Clear and portrait/landscape Cover/Contain rounded geometry/UV checks. Diagnostic test texture handles are never preview artwork.
- PASS existing aurora: 20,000 variable-dt/edge steps, attraction/release, 30/60/120 Hz agreement, bounded malformed/stalled time, hidden/reduced pause, 600 rounded geometry samples and 1,000 warmed allocation frames. Existing effects tests pass unchanged.
- PASS 1,000 warmed actual menu frames switching seven routes and all three themes: active ImGui allocation counts and vertex/index capacities stable.
- PASS 13 real captures with identical original feature snapshot, 15 PNG full decodes, two labeled sheets, 30 embedded PNG data URIs in offline viewer, 18-entry ZIP integrity. Inspected actual panels, theme states, Aurora preference scroller and 640×360 cards.
- PASS focused diff/whitelist review; original configuration declarations, build files, SDK/gameplay modules and previous checkpoints preserved.

KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS:
- SDK intentionally absent and NDK/device unavailable; no complete Android native build/link, real activity-path restart/storage, overlay/touch/GPU/texture lifecycle, FPS/power/thermal or file-save latency claim. Host filesystem and native ImGui checks are distinguished from Android testing.
- Anime has no supplied artwork or decoder yet. Its functional selection uses a dark fallback; the real texture/provider interface is ready for user assets. Asset ownership/upload/release must follow the documented render-thread/context contract.
- Persistence requires a writable activity private path; otherwise UI preferences remain session-only and report that status. Synchronous small-file saves occur only after finished edits; profile on-device latency later.
- Host rasterization can differ from native GPU AA/blending. Original embedded-font macro warnings remain untouched. ResetLogin remains accessible but its destructive/platform callback is intentionally not invoked by host tests.
- Full Aurora retains the approved bounded geometry budget; all-panel device performance remains unmeasured. Classic/Anime skip Aurora clocks, physics and draws; hidden menus submit no effects.

NEXT ACTION:
STOP after Phase B. User reviews previews/phase_b/index.html and the three theme previews, supplies real artwork when ready and explicitly directs Phase C or later work. Do not start sound playback, custom logo/launcher, key-entry functionality or Stage 6 automatically. The focused HEAD containing this document is the Phase B checkpoint; retrieve its hash with git log -1.

REFERENCE NOTES:
- Existing reference layout/navigation/window/control proportions and Crimson Eclipse identity remain.
- Aurora defaults reproduce approved Phase A physics/render geometry; new background integration extends across all seven routes only.
- Theme previews: aurora-style.png, anime-style.png, classic-style.png; each has a corresponding Player capture. Aurora preferences have a separate scrolled capture.
- High-resolution sheets: theme-contact-sheet.png (1968×2892), aurora-seven-panels.png (3912×3848). Small cards: style-640.png (640×360). Individual full captures: 1920×872.
- Preview ZIP: kennypvthax-phase-b-previews.zip. Source/feature/image hashes: verification.json. Bounded reproduction: tests/README.md.
- Earlier Stage 5.6 Phase A assets were subsequently exported to the private preview repository in preview-only commit 39254db; that historical export did not change the application HEAD. Phase B artifacts are new local outputs.

PREVIOUS PHASE A CHECKPOINT — RETAINED HISTORY:
The following describes the prior checkpoint and its then-current stop point.

PROJECT: KennyPvtHax

CURRENT STAGE:
Stage 5.6 — Phase A: Living Crimson Aurora & Interactive Starfield — COMPLETE
Checkpoint date: 10 October 2026 UTC. Parent application commit: af8a337.
STOP after Phase A. Phase B and Stage 6 require the user's next instruction.

THEME UPDATE:
Crimson Eclipse identity retained. Visual → Player ESP alone prototypes translucent crimson/ruby/scarlet/burgundy aurora curtains and an interactive starfield. All six other panels retain Stage 5.5 materials/effects and matched pixels. No layout/branding/control theme changes.

COMPLETED:
- Continued af8a337; read existing checkpoint/design notes, audited current source/cached reference frame/actual Stage 5.5 render. Preserved previous source history and prior preview/GitHub export notes.
- Added three independent smooth noise-advected curtain meshes with vertical rays, graded depth, asymmetric composition, near-black gaps and graphite chrome. Inspected the first render and softened overly distinct hems in favor of vertical folds.
- Replaced Player's former analytic points with 40 deterministic nonuniform stars, varied size/luminosity, gentle drift/twinkle and occasional shimmer. Fixed state, no per-frame particle containers, wrap/respawn or resource creation.
- Implemented distance-based background touch attraction, damped inertia, surviving home spring, smoothed visual target, localized curtain illumination/distortion and gradual release dispersion. Native controls are evaluated first; no feature/input/overlay-capture variable is changed by the effect.
- Preserved header dragging, navigation, close/reopen, scrolling and all existing appearance actions. Player's empty content now focuses its native non-moving child for star interaction; drag from the unchanged header. Other panels' empty-space behavior is unchanged.
- Added bounded 120 Hz fixed-step integration, max 12 steps/frame, finite/clamped delta, visible-only continuous clock, same-frame idempotence, inactive/hidden pause and the existing Reduced preference's complete prototype motion/response freeze.
- Rounded geometry containment includes all ribbon triangles, star halos and AA. Native channel buffers are reused; route selection after navigation prevents background spill onto another panel.
- Kept all 37 exact binding/range/format sites and every SDK/native integration. main.cpp, Helper/definition.h, Android.mk/Application.mk byte-identical to af8a337. No SDK recreation, source extraction/restart, gameplay edit, dependency install or new permissions.
- Added tracked reproducible host tests/extractor/capturer/rasterizer/packager. Rendered/inspected required timed/touch/release states, 640 scrolling viewport, baseline comparison and decoded animation samples.
- Saved 15 valid PNGs, a 145-frame continuous MP4, source/state/hash provenance, self-contained offline viewer and 19-entry preview ZIP under previews/stage5_6/. Retained earlier captures and GitHub uploads unchanged; new previews remain local.

MODIFIED FILES:
- jni/KennyAurora.h (new): procedural curtain geometry, seeded star state/physics, lighting response, clipping/reduced motion.
- jni/KennyMenu.h: Player-only routing, post-widget input observation, reused background channels, native content focus ownership.
- tests/kenny_aurora_check.cpp (new): physics/timing/boundary/geometry/star visibility/allocation checks.
- tests/kenny_host_fixture.py (new): actual source-extracted 37-binding host fixture, no SDK replacement.
- tests/kenny_menu_host_check.cpp (new): retained earlier native interaction suite plus Phase A ownership/attraction/release/isolation checks.
- tests/kenny_phase_a_capture.cpp (new): real production UI/font/ImGui capture sequence, matched state and continuous animation.
- tests/kenny_host_rasterize.cpp (new): CPU rasterization of actual indexed triangles/font atlas.
- tests/kenny_phase_a_package.py (new): PNG/video/comparison/viewer/provenance packaging and integrity checks.
- tests/README.md: bounded reproduction commands, tests and host/runtime limits.
- .gitignore: ignores previews/stage5_6/ generated output.
- UI_DESIGN_NOTES.md: audit, final implementation/interaction, observed geometry cost, evidence/limits.
- CODEX_PROGRESS.md: this checkpoint plus retained historical checkpoints/export records.
- Ignored local artifacts: generated fixture, executables, atlas, draw/state/presentation/RGBA/PNG captures, continuous film frames, inspection sheets and previews/stage5_6/. No binaries/artifacts/source backups/credentials committed.

VERIFICATION:
- PASS strict C++17 production-header syntax; focused aurora test built with -Wall -Wextra -Werror. Existing focused effects test also passes unchanged.
- PASS extractor inventory of all 37 real binding sites; source/configuration/build byte identity against af8a337. Native seven-panel suite passes original checkbox/slider/range/keyboard/conditional/shared bindings and category access/actions without changing gameplay code.
- PASS actual first-press native input: background attraction and checkbox priority without hover warmup; held/drag/release inertia and eventual home recovery; header dragging intact; background touch does not move the window or mutate features; outside-origin/exit cancellation; non-Player isolation; Reduced freeze/resume.
- PASS original five viewport fits, native scrolling, close/reopen, tab/subtab memory, appearance/reset/center actions, rapid navigation at 30/60/120 Hz, hidden rendering pause and balanced stacks.
- PASS deterministic 40-star initialization; mean nearby distance decreases 0.159→0.022 (12 stars) under held attraction, then returns within 0.003 normalized distance of drifting homes after release. No positional reset on release.
- PASS 20,000 variable-dt/edge/drag steps, 30/60/120 Hz agreement, negative/NaN/infinite/stalled delta, same-frame idempotence, hidden/reduced pause and long-session noise continuity.
- PASS 600 actual rounded draw-geometry samples at five scales/full/reduced plus all star halos remaining drawable; max 7,882 vertices / 41,628 indices, fixed state 992 bytes.
- PASS 1,000 warmed atmosphere frames and 1,000 actual seven-panel route-switching frames: native active allocation counts and draw-buffer capacities stable.
- PASS all six non-Player matched 1920×872 renders byte-identical to af8a337 through the same CPU rasterizer. Baseline C++ versus previous Python rasterizer differs at most one channel level; same viewport/feature/appearance state.
- PASS 15 PNG signatures/full decodes; all captures match original feature snapshot; actual idle time images differ; self-contained viewer has 32 exact image/video data URIs. High-resolution composites paste real captures without alteration, with external captions.
- PASS MP4 1920×872, 145 consecutive frames, 12 fps / approximately 12 s, encode plus full decode; 19-entry ZIP integrity. Inspected static states, before/after, small viewport and representative decoded video frames.
- PASS git diff --check and explicit source whitelist review before checkpoint commit.

KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS:
- SDK intentionally absent; NDK/device unavailable. No Android build/link, actual overlay/touch/keyboard/GPU verification or mobile FPS/power claim. Host input stands in for existing Android-to-ImGui mapping; previews use neutral background, not game/device capture.
- Aurora uses more geometry than Stage 5.5 (7,882/41,628 vs 1,961/8,928 observed maxima). Bounded buffers/no new textures are verified on host; profile real mobile hardware before wider rollout. Reduced freezes all motion/response; native visible drawing remains.
- Host rasterization can differ from GPU AA/blending; original embedded-font macro warnings are preserved. Preferences are session-only. ResetLogin platform/destructive callback is bound but intentionally not invoked in host tests.
- Codex Android artifact access previously failed. Local PNGs/MP4/self-contained viewer/ZIP are verified; new GitHub upload is not authorized by the prior nine-image Stage 5.5 permission and was not performed.

NEXT ACTION:
User reviews previews/stage5_6/index.html or living-crimson.mp4 and the individual PNGs; await explicit direction for Phase A adjustments or a subsequent phase. Do not implement Phase B, Anime theme, sound, logo launcher, key-pasting UI or Stage 6 automatically. Checkpoint commit is the focused HEAD containing this document; use git log -1 to retrieve its hash.

REFERENCE NOTES:
- Existing reference window/navigation/header/secondary rows, native control proportions and compact grouped panels remain. Current background responds only in unoccupied Player content; header remains the drag region.
- Idle PNGs: aurora-00/02/03/06/10.png; idle-stars.png; center-touch.png; dragged-touch.png; release-00/02/10.png; reduced.png.
- Compare: before-af8a337.png, before-after.png (3904×1008), contact-sheet.png (3904×3848).
- Continuous video is a separate timeline: 0–4 s idle, 4–6 held, 6–8 dragged, 8–12 released; 60 Hz input/120 Hz physics sampled at 12 fps. Export cadence is not device performance.
- Tests/README.md has bounded reproduction; retain original af8a337 baseline draw/state/atlas and Stage 5.5 provenance for comparison packaging. UI_DESIGN_NOTES.md records detailed math/input/performance limitations.

PREVIOUS STAGE 5.5 CHECKPOINT AND EXPORT RECORDS — RETAINED HISTORY:
The following sections describe the earlier completed stage, not the current next action.

THEME UPDATE:
Crimson Eclipse: near-black #060609, graphite #100B0F, elevated #1A1014, burgundy undertones, crimson #C1122B / fire red #EA233B, restrained #FF5664 highlights, pearl/rose selection ink and neutral inactive outlines. No lavender accents. Same reference geometry, grouped layouts and native architecture. Defaults: 97% opacity, Standard spacing, Full motion; preferences are session-only.

COMPLETED:
- Resumed 4eaedda and preserved Stages 1–5. Read checkpoint/design notes, reviewed production UI and cached reference frames 05/24, visually audited all seven Stage 5 captures. No restart, extraction, checkout/revert, SDK replacement or gameplay edit.
- Recorded design audit and implementation in UI_DESIGN_NOTES.md: replace uniform wash/repeated red outlines with hierarchy, signature identity and coordinated materials.
- Added original primitive-drawn K/eclipse monogram, fitted KennyPvtHax wordmark and crisp small CRIMSON ECLIPSE descriptor in the existing brand/drag region; reused existing atlas fonts/resources.
- Refined shared surfaces into near-black burgundy glass, graphite header/secondary hierarchy, slowly varying crown light, shadowed lower corona and faint opposing light. Removed rectangular child wash/footer artifact; retained exact window proportions/padding/routes.
- Curated 40 bounded deterministic points (24 stationary stars, 12 drifting micro-embers, 4 rare sparkles), one inward delicate rim and rare short edge glints. Reduced from 48 particles, with fewer observed effect vertices/indices. Rounded containment includes halos and AA; no blur/new textures/framework.
- Improved navigation with restrained pale selection ink, smooth fading indicator, dark hover surfaces and refined pills. Shaded circular checkbox fills, crisp ticks, graduated thin slider tracks, soft handle highlights and fading section separators share the same art direction. Native hitboxes/IDs/returns/values remain unchanged.
- Added genuine session-only Full/Reduced Style preference, responsive Motion group and scoped motion behavior. Reduced freezes ambient time, renders only static stars, omits glints/drifting/sparkling points and snaps transitions. Reset appearance restores all defaults without changing original features. Close/reopen and scrolling preserve preference.
- Removed the old global 4096-second reset; double analytic motion remains continuous, same-frame clock advancement is idempotent, hidden frames submit no geometry/callbacks or time catch-up. Lighting is calculated once per visible draw. Fixed 192-entry/3072-byte visual cache remains.
- Retained every one of 37 original exact binding/range/format call sites and all callbacks. main.cpp/configuration/build/SDK/native integrations and prior branding remain unchanged. No simulated controls, saved-key changes or SDK-dependent edits.
- Generated actual before/after renders at identical 1920×872 / visible time 2 s / original configuration / 97% opacity / Standard spacing / Full effects. Read-only git-show baseline headers reproduce all seven Stage 5 PNGs byte-for-byte; working tree was never switched.
- Inspected all seven full-size and seven small candidate panels and representative atmosphere samples. Corrected tiny initial descriptor and child wash before final capture. No new horizontal overlap/clipping or rounded cutoff found. Small content continues to scroll.
- Packaged 30 actual PNGs (7 before, 14 panel/viewport after, 8 Full time samples, 1 Reduced), self-contained comparison/wipe/download/playback viewer, source/image/state provenance and verified ZIP under previews/stage5_5/. Retained Stage 2–5 image hashes unchanged.

MODIFIED FILES:
- jni/KennyPaint.h (new): bounded cached shaded-disc and fading-seam primitives.
- jni/KennyIdentity.h (new): original K/eclipse mark and fitted two-level wordmark.
- jni/ClaudeTheme.h: Crimson Eclipse tokens, graphite hover/selection/pill material.
- jni/KennyEffects.h: layered rounded atmosphere, mixed 40-point budget/glints, continuous visible timing, reduced rendering.
- jni/KennyMenu.h: identity/atmosphere integration, scoped reduced motion, refined indicator/separators and transparent child surface. Measurements/routing remain.
- jni/KennyMotion.h: scoped presentation-only reduced interpolation; fixed cache unchanged.
- jni/KennyControls.h: shaded circular checks, refined track/handle material; native input/bindings unchanged.
- jni/KennyPanels.h: neutral/fading subtle dividers; responsive sizing/grouping unchanged.
- jni/KennyAppearance.h: genuine Full/Reduced preference, responsive third Style group, Crimson Eclipse About identity.
- tests/kenny_effects_check.cpp: reduced/idempotent/long-running/scope tests; full/reduced rounded geometry coverage.
- tests/README.md: actual-production-header verification/reproduction and host limitations.
- .gitignore: generated previews/stage5_5/ ignored.
- UI_DESIGN_NOTES.md: audit, completed design/motion/material/provenance, checks and Stage 6 handoff.
- CODEX_PROGRESS.md: this checkpoint.
- Ignored local artifacts: .verification/stage5_5_fixture.py/.h, check.cpp/executable, headers.cpp, baseline_headers/, before fixture/check/atlas/rasterizer, actual draw/state/presentation/PNG files, package.py, viewer_check.js, strict effect-test executable; previews/stage5_5/ PNGs/index.html/baseline.json/verification.json/README.md/stage5_5-previews.zip. No generated binaries or unrelated dependencies are committed.

VERIFICATION:
- PASS strict C++17 production-header syntax check with -Wall -Wextra -Werror; focused test compiled with these flags against real unchanged ImGui core. No fabricated SDK headers.
- PASS rebuilt expanded native ImGui host interaction suite: all 30 original checkbox sites toggle/restore at 640 after scrolling, native focus activation, float/integer endpoints and Ctrl-click numeric input, shared Aim/Misc bindings/FOV conditional controls. All 37 exact call sites/ranges preserved; main.cpp byte-identical to 4eaedda.
- PASS all five primary categories/secondary tab memory, appearance callback isolation, opacity endpoints/clamping/scoping, both row presets, Center window/Reset appearance without feature changes, dragging/close/reopen/position retention, scrolling, balanced font/style/color stacks.
- PASS viewport bounds and horizontal label/item fit at 1920×872, 2340×1080, 1280×720, 960×540, 640×360. Both spacing modes remain usable; lower controls including Motion are reached through native scrolling.
- PASS real Full/Reduced selection at 1920 and 640; 90 reduced frames freeze clock; scope is restored outside menu; selected indicator snaps; Full resumes; reset/defaults and close/reopen preserve original feature snapshots.
- PASS rapid actual category targets at 30/60/120 Hz; finite bounded non-overshooting indicators; inactive slider artwork independent of immediate underlying value; 120 hidden frames submit no menu geometry/callbacks or clock updates; correct reopen recovery.
- PASS focused native floating-toggle 84×36/release/disabled behavior, finite/clamped timing, frame-rate agreement, 2000 rapid targets, pressure across 9999 widget IDs, stale recovery, nested reduced scopes, same-frame idempotence, long-running continuous light math.
- PASS 1000 full/reduced geometry samples/five scales: every actual atmosphere vertex including halos/AA/glints inside rounded menu. Observed max 1961 vertices / 8928 indices, down from 2425 / 10584 in Stage 5. Visual cache remains 192 entries / 3072 bytes.
- PASS 1000 warmed atmosphere frames: native buffers and active allocation count stable. PASS 1000 actual seven-panel route-switching frames after warmup: native ImGui allocation count and draw-buffer capacities stable. These are host checks, not Android FPS/resource guarantees.
- PASS main.cpp, Helper/definition.h, Android.mk and Application.mk byte-identical to 4eaedda; all seven baseline renders freshly reproduced byte-for-byte; all seven before/after original feature snapshots and presentation conditions match. Existing Stage 2–5 PNG hashes preserved.
- PASS actual rasterizations visually inspected: same seven before/after pixel bounds, deliberate more localized lighting and identity/control hierarchy; later Full samples differ with feature values fixed. All seven large/small after panels inspected. No Android visual-match claim.
- PASS 30 PNG signatures/CRC/RGBA/dimensions/integrity/full decodes; 34 byte-exact embedded/download URIs; Node DOM-emulated viewer image/download selection, seven wipes at 0/50/100%, all time/reduced samples, play/pause/hidden stop; 34-entry ZIP CRC check. No live browser screenshot claim.
- PASS focused source diff review and git diff --check. Commit uses only the 14 source/test/documentation paths above; original dependencies/binaries/secrets are excluded.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- jni/SDK/ intentionally absent; Android NDK/device unavailable. Full native Android build/link, platform touch/overlay/soft keyboard, GPU AA/blending/appearance and device FPS remain unverified. Do not install substitutes or regenerate SDK.
- Host previews use real UI source/core/fonts with illustrative test configuration, CPU indexed-triangle rasterization and neutral backdrop. Game/platform/floating-toggle capture excluded; GPU output may differ. Original application defaults unchanged.
- Playback swaps captured PNGs once per second, demonstrating actual atmospheric differences rather than full-speed control transitions or device frame rate. Codex file-browser rendering cannot be directly asserted; download/open self-contained HTML if PNG viewer reports No image.
- At 640×360 content, including the third Motion group, wraps below the initial viewport; existing native scrolling is verified. Preferences remain session-only with no new persistence keys.
- Guest Reset remains connected to ResetLogin; native accessibility verified, destructive/platform callback not invoked. Original fontAwesome.hpp malformed/redefined macro warnings remain; strict production UI headers are warning-free.
- Selective baseline leaves original source/dependency trees untracked; explicit focused add paths are required. Generated verification/previews are local/ignored. Do not commit unrelated sources, binaries, credentials or dependency trees.

NEXT STAGE:
Stage 6 — Final Source Audit, Android Build Validation, and Visual Verification

NEXT ACTION:
WAIT for the user's next instruction. When authorized, read this checkpoint and Stage 5.5 notes, inspect Git/current previews, restore the user's ORIGINAL SDK and compatible NDK, audit all 37 binding/range sites, build the real Android component and validate overlay/touch/keyboard, GPU rounding/blending, scrolling, dragging/visibility, reduced/full effects and device performance against cached references. If native tools/device remain absent, run feasible checks and clearly leave native acceptance unverified. Do not restart earlier stages or recreate SDK.

REFERENCE NOTES:
Cached .reference/frame-{05,09,12,15,18,24,27}.jpg retained; Stage 5.5 reviewed 05/24 and existing actual Stage 5 captures without reprocessing the video. Reference approximately 1135×713 at (392,80); current host 1133×715 at (393,78), 34 px radius, 100/74 px header/secondary bands at 1920×872. Five horizontal categories and compact equal columns retained. Crimson Eclipse intentionally translates the purple reference identity.

GIT CHECKPOINT:
Preserved b73a33a, 8bffdcd, 042e39c, f744bc4, 457a6f5 and 4eaedda. Stage 5.5: focused commit containing this checkpoint, subject Stage 5.5: refine Crimson Eclipse identity and layered UI materials. Obtain hash with git log -1 --oneline; ignored preview metadata records it after commit.

HISTORICAL PREVIEW-ACCESS CHECKPOINT (preserved from work before Stage 3):
STAGE 2 PREVIEW ACCESS CHECKPOINT — 10 October 2026:
- User reported that the Codex PNG file viewer showed "No image" for `.verification/visual-1920.png`.
- Verified the original file: valid PNG signature, 1920×872 RGBA, 94,090 bytes, all four PNG chunk CRCs valid, Pillow integrity verification and full pixel decode passed. Regeneration was unnecessary.
- Saved a byte-identical, readable copy at `/workspace/KennyPvtHax/previews/stage2/visual-1920.png` and inspected it through the image tool.
- Added `previews/stage2/index.html`, a self-contained offline image viewer with the exact original PNG embedded in both the image and download link. Verified both embedded data URIs decode byte-for-byte to the PNG. This viewer displays a real image artifact; it does not recreate or simulate application UI.
- Added `previews/stage2/verification.json` and `README.md` with provenance, integrity details, and retrieval guidance; generated preview artifacts are ignored by Git.
- PNG SHA-256: `b032edfd567a488266cfde705dd0fba769783ec4f2aed81422557e6ef0828def`.
- Provenance: production `KennyMenu::Draw`, original control statements, bundled ImGui, and supplied fonts; host test configuration and CPU rasterization of actual draw data. Not an AI image or live Android/game screenshot. No game/background, floating toggle, platform integration, or GPU validation is included.
- Confirmed `jni/main.cpp`, `jni/KennyMenu.h`, and `jni/ClaudeTheme.h` remain byte-identical to commit `042e39c`. No UI functionality changed and no prior commits were discarded. At that preview-only checkpoint, HEAD remained `042e39c`; only documentation and the generated-artifact ignore entry were updated.
- The image tool successfully read/displayed the PNG. The user's Codex file-browser rendering path cannot be directly verified here; if it still shows "No image", download/open the self-contained HTML viewer in a normal browser. Both PNG and viewer live at the non-hidden `previews/stage2/` path.
- Historical status: Stage 3 was paused then; the user subsequently authorized the crimson Stage 3 implementation recorded above.


STAGE 5.5 PREVIEW EXPORT ACCESS CHECKPOINT — 10 October 2026 (Asia/Calcutta):
- User reported Codex artifact download failure. Current HEAD remains af8a337; no UI/tests/backend/native source or prior commit was changed, and Stage 6 remains stopped.
- Reverified all 30 original PNGs against verification.json: existence/nonempty, PNG signature, chunk bounds/CRC, Pillow integrity/full decode, RGBA/dimensions and exact SHA256. All source hashes and implementation commit match. No regeneration was needed.
- Added previews/stage5_5/export/: byte-identical copies of all 30 PNGs, readable mode 0644 in a 0755 directory; seven final 1920×872 panels remain individual PNGs.
- Added all-panels-contact-sheet.png (3508×2627) with seven labeled native-pixel tiles; crops only the neutral surrounding backdrop. Each pasted tile's pixel bytes equal its source crop exactly.
- Added before-after-player.png (3928×1050), retaining both complete 1920×872 viewport images at matched time/state. Both pasted viewport rectangles equal their source image pixels exactly. Baseline is 4eaedda; after is af8a337.
- Displayed both composites and all seven final PNGs through the image-content tool, then inspected the output. Added self-contained export/index.html with nine embedded images, native-size view and per-PNG save link; all 11 image/download URIs match exported PNG bytes.
- Added export/retrieve.py, RETRIEVE.md and export-verification.json. Tested base64 roundtrip retrieval of Player, contact sheet and comparison; unsafe filenames rejected. This workspace-text transfer bypasses the Codex artifact bridge and requires copying complete terminal output then local base64 decode. SHA256 checks detect incomplete copies.
- No generic file-upload/attachment capability is exposed in this session. Actual user-side Codex downloader is not directly testable, so the download-service error is not claimed repaired. Local file links, direct image-content display and verified workspace retrieval are provided. No external publication or unsupported URL is created.
- PNG originals, original viewer/ZIP/provenance and all previous work are preserved; generated export files and .verification/stage5_5_export.py are ignored. Only this checkpoint documentation changed in tracked files. No new Git commit was created, keeping HEAD exactly af8a337.
- Exact export directory: /workspace/KennyPvtHax/previews/stage5_5/export/.
- NEXT ACTION: wait for user inspection/instruction; do not begin Stage 6.

- Export accessibility refinement: original project and Stage 5.5 parent directories are mode 0700; private project permissions were preserved. Published byte-identical local copies of all 32 PNGs, viewer/retriever/docs/manifest at /workspace/preview_exports/kenny-crimson-eclipse/, with both export directories 0755 and files 0644. These are local workspace exports, not an external publication or hosted URL. This removes parent-directory permission barriers for the export copies, without asserting the Codex downloader is repaired. Public copy hashes match every project export; source/HEAD remain unchanged.


PRIVATE GITHUB PREVIEW EXPORT — PREPARED, AWAITING DESTINATION / AUTHORIZATION:
Date: 10 October 2026 (Asia/Calcutta).
- User requested a separate private repository containing preview images only, explicitly prohibiting upload/push until private destination confirmation. No remote writes, repository creation, commits or pushes have occurred.
- Prepared /workspace/preview_exports/github-stage5-5/ with exactly nine PNG files: player-1920.png, world-1920.png, aim-1920.png, bullet-1920.png, extra-1920.png, style-1920.png, settings-1920.png, all-panels-contact-sheet.png, before-after-player.png. Total 2,058,030 bytes. No source, Git history, HTML, scripts, manifest/configuration data, credentials or other files are in the upload directory.
- Verified seven final 1920×872 images against af8a337 renderer manifest/SHA256. Contact sheet 3508×2627 and comparison 3928×1050 preserve actual host screenshot pixels exactly; comparison includes Stage 5 (4eaedda) and Stage 5.5 (af8a337) at matched 1920×872/state/time. PNG signature/chunk CRC/full decode checks pass; only IHDR/IDAT/IEND chunks, no embedded text metadata; no symlinks.
- GitHub connector authenticated-user read and gh auth status / gh api user succeeded as KennyPVTHax. Binary Git blob/tree/commit/ref upload APIs are exposed, and authenticated CLI is available. Target repository privacy/write access remain unverified because the destination is not yet specified. No credential values were printed or saved.
- Local audit/selected-image Git blob SHA and SHA256 manifest is .verification/github_preview_export_manifest.json, deliberately outside the image-only export folder. Source project remains at af8a337 with earlier preview-access documentation changes retained; UI/tests/native/SDK code is unchanged.
- Exact next action: obtain PRIVATE GitHub repository URL and user's explicit authorization for these nine images (proposed remote folder stage5-5/ on the repository default branch). Read repository metadata first; verify private=true and write access. Then upload ONLY whitelisted PNG files from the clean export, using an independent preview-only Git/API operation, never pushing this project's source repository/history. Preserve existing remote content and validate resulting image Git blob SHA/bytes. Return authenticated github.com image links for Android viewing. Do not write to a public/inaccessible/unconfirmed repository. Do not begin Stage 6.


PRIVATE GITHUB PREVIEW EXPORT — COMPLETE / VERIFIED:
Date: 10 October 2026 (Asia/Calcutta).
- User explicitly confirmed private destination KennyPVTHax/KennyPvtHax-Previews and authorized ONLY nine approved PNGs under stage5-5/ on its default branch.
- GitHub metadata confirmed private=true / visibility=private, permissions.push=true, archived=false, disabled=false and default branch main before uploading; the repository was empty. Privacy/default branch were rechecked before each write and after completion.
- Uploaded exactly the nine whitelisted PNGs from /workspace/preview_exports/github-stage5-5/ using normal GitHub Contents API commits. No force-push, application Git remote/history change, or upload of source/config/credentials/manifests/scripts/README/other files. Remote recursive tree contains ONLY nine PNG paths under stage5-5/.
- Downloaded all nine binary Git blobs back through authenticated API and compared bytes, SHA256, Git blob SHA and sizes against selected local images; all match. All images are actual production C++/ImGui host-rendered output, with native-pixel composite exports; no Android runtime or Stage 6 work was performed.
- Preview repository final commit: b3c81f4fdb14edd21e748c7ba39d87660d248106. Application repository HEAD remains af8a337; UI/tests/native/SDK files and all prior commits are unchanged. Only local checkpoint documentation changed, retaining earlier export-access notes; no application commit was made.
- GitHub folder: https://github.com/KennyPVTHax/KennyPvtHax-Previews/tree/main/stage5-5
- Files: player-1920.png, world-1920.png, aim-1920.png, bullet-1920.png, extra-1920.png, style-1920.png, settings-1920.png, all-panels-contact-sheet.png, before-after-player.png.
- Local audited result: .verification/github_preview_upload_result.json; manifest authorization/destination/upload status updated in .verification/github_preview_export_manifest.json. Upload helper remains ignored/local, never uploaded.
- NEXT ACTION: user opens individual GitHub image links while signed into an account with private-repository access on Android. Wait for user inspection/instruction; do not begin Stage 6.

BuildID: fc3f77558c7a52228ccf0d309bfec9f227bbe8de.

All ten existing host suites passed with AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer:
menu, launcher, audio, theme, Aurora, effects, characters, media, diagnostics, fonts.
New continuation sanitizer test and actual C3 ImGui capture interactions passed.
Exact 37 binding/range/callback checks and protected runtime/media comparisons pass.
Existing menu tests cover native interactions, navigation, drag/close/reopen,
small viewport scrolling, warm allocation stability and repeated theme switches.
Existing character tests cover 10,000 allocation-free cached dispatch/mix cycles.
A new test initially advanced event time without draining the simulated audio
clock; corrected the test, without changing the working single-voice mixer.

Actual CPU-rasterized native ImGui PNGs and offline viewer are generated under
previews/full-continuation/. Anime Settings and Aurora captures visually inspected.
No synthetic artwork, Android GPU screenshot or authentic Rias voice claim.
The subsequent verification checkpoint changes only documentation, test timing
and generated-preview ignore rules; application sources match the built commit.
Next: owner tests this artifact on Android before any production promotion.

## Final verification checkpoint

Compiled source: `2a54a41b6ee7de42bf91a34437e66a499e599323`. Full ARM64 run
https://github.com/KennyPVTHax/KennyPvtHax-Backup/actions/runs/38422703802 succeeded
with unchanged NDK `25.2.9519653`; artifact `11826799895`.
Actual downloaded ZIP: CRC/exact two entries, ELF64/AArch64, source/isolation/NDK
metadata, and matching runtime hash verified.
Library SHA-256: `e2fc6995a2741cd51f385c5b54a420eb168c0b6c51ffa1c0bbb9ab6787ca2b3f`.
ZIP SHA-256: `7ddeaef30f88ab5c18ac574879a34c7537faa6743c015d548c28811f9b59ed6b`.
Build ID: `e38cca0d9be6285cec43e7370e2faf3e4b61e784`.

All twelve host ASan/UBSan suites PASS: menu, launcher, audio, theme, Aurora,
effects, characters, media, diagnostics, fonts, continuation, supplied media.
Exact 37 binding/range checks PASS. Protected runtime paths and existing source
SDK/build configuration match the working full baseline. The supplied test
uses actual user WAV samples and real native control clicks, verifies all four
event mappings, rapid-toggle suppression, idle/unrelated/missing-event silence,
selected-character isolation and 50 theme changes. PNG loader alpha, cached upload,
visibility and K fallback PASS. Existing suites cover persistence, dragging,
close/reopen, scrolling, viewport fit, corruption, resource reuse and allocation
stability. No additional Android playback/GPU/runtime evidence is claimed.

Five actual texture-aware C++/ImGui CPU captures are under previews/supplied-media/;
Anime player/Settings screenshots and checkerboard alpha cutout visually inspected.
Contact sheet/offline viewer included in private preview bundle. New host serializer
embeds the real RGBA texture; it does not paint a mock character onto a screenshot.

Private media bundle: KennyPvtHax-Supplied-Rias-Private-Media.zip, 19 files,
2079652 bytes; SHA-256 `4c261812a836c0c026bfba37cd5996cc7c6b69ac39d218e891d7b1b4c2a70782`.
ZIP CRC, each byte-exact original and each converted runtime digest match inventory.
Rejected image-editor redraw, caches and build outputs are excluded. User media
remain private; neither Git history nor public artifacts contain them.

The final checkpoint updates documentation only. Runtime sources/assets metadata
remain identical to the compiled commit above. Next: owner installs the exact .so
AND private media pack, selects Rias / supplied event clips, and device-tests before
any production promotion. No Anilxkenny/kenny.json update occurred.

## Verified Checkpoint A delivery

Thirteen ASan/UBSan host suites PASS on 24443ae; focused recovery check PASS again
after the missing-pack selection diagnostic correction at 9a3de44. Exact 37
binding/range and protected startup/input/EGL/SDK/blank-header checks pass.
Private package validates all 12 runtime hashes/formats, rejects corrupt/missing/
traversing/noncanonical entries, and stages offline without installing on Android.
All runtime media bytes remain identical to the previous verified conversion.
Private package SHA-256: `a244ecddf76c3ed9fc4f61142bbf653385697961d99bfe7445d6a4c0ff07146c`.
Actual ImGui Test Voice/640 captures inspected; they are host CPU output, not Android
speaker or GPU verification. Callback transport tests exercise the bounded atomic
mailbox; they do not simulate successful OpenSL playback.

Root cause confirmed by user: only the old .so was installed, not supplied media.
No actual host source/ADB connection is available. On-device private import and
audible direct Test Voice remain required before moving beyond A. No source
media, private symbols, video/logo implementation, main merge, Anilxkenny upload
or kenny.json update. Final checkpoint after this build changes documentation/
generated-capture ignore rules only; compiled application bytes remain identical.
